      <p>I graduated high school in 2001 from Lowville Academy and Central School and attended S.U.N.Y Brockport in Rochester,
        New York. I received my Bachelors Degree in Business Adminstration in 2006. While there I was the starting goalie
        on the varsity Lacrosse team and currently have 2 school records. Currently, I have the most saves in a season and
        most safes in a game.
      </p>

      <p>
        After graduating college, I entered the sales world and received my first job role as a sales representative at Cutco Inc.
        While this was fun, I wanted to do more and see more of the United States, so I decided to move to Raleigh, North
        Carolina on a whim. I have never regreted this decision and see how this city is expanding and growing and becoming
        one my favorite cities in the United States.
      </p>

      <p>
        Shortly after moving down from New York I was diagnosed with stage IV Germ Cell cancer and battled that for 3 years. I finally
        rid my cancer after completing 3 months (3 sessions) of Bone Marrow/Stem Cell Transplants and having been in remission
        now for 5 years! But, while I was undergoing chemo and all the other procedures, I realized I needed to make important
        changes in my life, for example; diet, exercise and career. Now I want to better myself with computer technology
        and expand my knowledge in the computer world.
